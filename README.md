**Semantria SDKs**

** _This SDK has been superceded. See the [Semantria 5 Documentation](https://semantria-docs.lexalytics.com/docs) for info on how to access the new API._ **

[Semantria](https://www.lexalytics.com/semantria) is a text analytics and sentiment analysis API. It allows you to gain valuable insights from your unstructured text content by extracting entities, categories, topics, themes, facets, and sentiment. It is based on Lexalyticsâ€™ [Salience](https://www.lexalytics.com/salience/server) engine.

The Semantria SDKs are the most convenient way to integrate with the Semantria API to build a continuous or high-volume application. The SDKs implement all available Semantria features and include some simple examples of their use. However, the examples are not intended to demonstrate the best practices for processing large volumes of data. Please contact Lexalytics for guidance if you plan to build your own application.

For small volume, or ad-hoc, interactive data exploration check out [Semantria for Excel](https://www.lexalytics.com/semantria/excel).

Please visit [semantria.readme.io](https://semantria.readme.io/docs/) for complete API documentation.
